"editdist" is a CPython module that calculates the Levenshtein edit
distance between two strings. 

To install, use the standard Python distutils incantation:

	python setup.py build
	python setup.py install

Regression tests are in the test.py file.

py-editdist is licensed under a ISC/BSD licence. See the LICENSE file
for details.

Please report bugs to Damien Miller <djm@mindrot.org>. Please check the
TODO file first, in case your problem is something I already know about
(please send patches!)

A simple example that demonstrates the module:

	import editdist

	# Calculate an edit distance
	d = editdist.distance("abcd", "abcef")
