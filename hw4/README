We implemented METEOR tuning with PRO.

The following features were used:
- number of target words
- number of Russian-looking target words
- alignment features: distance to the diagonal, number and distance of forward / backward jumps, fertility (binned), word pair features
- Brown clusters 10-gram LM and lexical TM
- discriminative word lexicon (trained on small amounts of data)
